		<p>
			In my few years of being a netizen <i>(internet+citizen = netizen)</i>, I've seen many pinging others and themselves disappearing shortly after in the chat rooms I hang around in. You may need to ping a person for some obvious reason, but it should be kept in mind that you're also requesting the person to spend his/her valuable time for you.
		</p>

		<p>
			This example shown above is a really, really bad way of pinging someone in a formal discussion. Why? The person whom you're pinging may be busy in something important. S/he may think that you're pinging him/her for something really important. However, if you yourself don't respond quickly after pinging, it'll be an obvious waste of time for the person you're pinging.
		</p>

		<p>
			In general, when you ping someone in a formal discussion, you're reqesting him/her to spend his/her time for you. What you're trying to say can be written in a single message, which saves time for both, like below:
		</p>

		<div class="chatbox">

			<div class="msg-block">
				<div class="msg-time">09:41pm</div>
				<div class="msg">
					<span class="mention">@Bob</span>
					can you please ask Alice to check if she has my notebook? I can't seem to find it, neither I can contact her right now. She lives next to your apartment, so it'd be easy for you to contact her. Please let me know if she has my notebook or not.<br>
					TIA

			<div class="msg-block right">
				<div class="msg-time">09:42pm</div>
				<div class="msg">Okay, I'm on it.</div>
			</div>

		</div>

		<p>Just say what you want to say, dammit!</p>
